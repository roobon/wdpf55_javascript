<!-- Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.
<script>
    var x = 5; // global scope
    function sleep() {  // function declare
        // inside the function => function / local scope

    } 
    sleep(); // function call
</script>

ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

<script>
    if(a = b){
        console.log("I will give you 500 taka")
    }
</script>
apart from function scope whenever you find a curly braces, inside the curly braces is Block Scope -->


<script>
    if(true){
        let x = 6;
        console.log(x);
    }
    console.log(x); //  Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined will be showed in browser
</script>

<script>
    let x = 7;
    if(true){
        let x = 8
        console.log(x); // 8 will be shown
    }
    console.log(x); // 7 will be shown here bcz Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
</script>

Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.

Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
